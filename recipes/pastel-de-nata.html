            <h3><strong>Step by Step:</strong></h3>
            <ol>
                <h4>Prepare the pastry:</h4>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 220°C (425°F) and lightly grease a muffin tin or use individual tart molds.
                </li>
                <li>Roll out the puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface until it becomes a thin rectangle.
                </li>
                <li>Starting from the shorter end, tightly roll up the pastry into a log. Cut the log into small slices, about 1 centimeter thick.
                     Press each slice into the bottom and up the sides of the muffin tin or tart molds, forming the pastry crusts.
                </li>
                <li> In a separate bowl, whisk together the sugar and flour. Add the egg yolks to the sugar mixture and whisk until well combined and smooth.
                </li>
                <li> Gradually pour the warm milk into the egg mixture, whisking constantly.
                </li>
                <li>Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring continuously, until it thickens and comes to a gentle boil. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.
                </li>
                <li>Allow the custard filling to cool for a few minutes, then pour it into the prepared pastry crusts.
                </li>
                <li> Bake the Pastel de Natas in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes or until the pastry is golden and the custard is set with a slight jiggle in the center.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove the tarts from the oven and let them cool in the tin or molds for a few minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once cooled, dust the Pastel de Natas with ground cinnamon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve the Pastel de Natas warm or at room temperature and enjoy the delicious taste of these Portuguese custard tarts!
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Note: For an extra touch, you can sprinkle a little powdered sugar on top or use a kitchen torch to caramelize the tops of the custard before dusting with cinnamon.</p>
