            <h3><strong>Step by Step:</strong></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Start by prepping the salted cod. Rinse the cod under cold water to remove excess salt. 
                    Place it in a bowl and cover with cold water. Let it soak for at least 8 hours, changing the water a few times to remove more salt. 
                    Once desalted, drain the cod and remove any bones or skin. Shred the cod into small pieces and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
                    Add the sliced onions and minced garlic, and sauté until the onions become soft and translucent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the shredded cod to the skillet and cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally until the cod is cooked through and starts to slightly brown. 
                    Remove the cod mixture from the skillet and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the same skillet, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil and heat over medium heat. 
                    Add the potato strips and fry until they turn golden and crispy. 
                    Remove the potatoes from the skillet and drain them on a paper towel to remove excess oil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a large bowl, combine the cooked cod mixture and fried potato strips. Season with salt and pepper to taste and toss to mix well.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reduce the heat to low and return the cod and potato mixture to the skillet. 
                    Pour the beaten eggs over the mixture and gently stir until the eggs are cooked and evenly distributed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove the skillet from the heat. 
                    Sprinkle fresh parsley over the Bacalhau à Brás and give it a final toss to incorporate the parsley.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve the Bacalhau à Brás hot, garnished with additional parsley and black olives if desired.
                </li>
            </ol>
