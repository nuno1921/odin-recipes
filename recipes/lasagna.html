        <h3><strong>Step by Step:</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente.
                Drain and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large skillet, brown the ground beef over medium heat until fully cooked.
                Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook until the onion is soft and translucent.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, sugar, salt, and pepper. 
                Simmer the sauce for about 20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. 
                Adjust the seasoning if needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a separate bowl, mix the ricotta cheese with half of the shredded mozzarella and half of the grated Parmesan. 
                Season with salt and pepper to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
                To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish.
                Place three lasagna noodles on top.
                Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles.
                Repeat the layers, finishing with a layer of meat sauce on top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle the remaining shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan over the top layer of meat sauce.
            </li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
                Then, remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.
                Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slice and serve the lasagna while still warm.
                Enjoy this comforting and delicious Italian favorite!
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note: You can customize your lasagna by adding layers of sautéed vegetables like mushrooms, spinach, or zucchini, between the meat sauce and cheese layers if desired.</p>
